    Beach Mission will be back next summer, and all children and young people will be welcome to join in. There will be activities every weekday for 0-17 year olds in six different age groups. Everyone is welcome, and activities are free (apart from a contribution for the outing). Activities include games, crafts, competitions, an outing, and interactive Bible based activities appropriate for each age group.


    Children and young people are welcome to attend whichever sessions they wish - we don't need to know in advance which sessions they will be coming to.


    Check out our age groups and session times below.  Locations and timings might change a little for 2025, but the 2024 information will give you an idea what to expect.  (Note that ages are "as at 31st August")

about:
  title: What Is Beach Mission?
  content: >-
    The Port St Mary SU Beach Mission was founded in 1901 and is a
    well-established event with excellent support from local authorities and
    churches. Since the decline of tourism in the area, the mission now works
    almost entirely with local children and young people, some of whom travel
    from other parts of the island. Around 200 children and young people attend
    daily to enjoy activities including games, crafts, drama, interactive Bible
    teaching, music and outings.


    ![Port St Mary Beach Mission Poster. Open to all 0-17s. Free Bible-themed activities. 27th July - 8th August 2025. Information (including booking) is at psmbm.im or find us on Facebook @psmbeachmission](/files/psmbmposter2025.jpg)
