    Beach Mission will be back this summer, and all children and young people will be welcome to join in. There will be activities every weekday for 0-17 year olds in six different age groups. Everyone is welcome, and activities are free (apart from a contribution for the outing). Activities include games, crafts, competitions, an outing, and interactive Bible based activities appropriate for each age group.


    Children and young people are welcome to attend whichever sessions they wish - we don't need to know in advance which sessions they will be coming to.

about:
  title: What Is Beach Mission?
  content: >-
    The Port St Mary SU Beach Mission was founded in 1901 and is a
    well-established event with excellent support from local authorities and
    churches. Since the decline of tourism in the area, the mission now works
    almost entirely with local children and young people, some of whom travel
    from other parts of the island. Around 250 children and young people attend
    daily to enjoy activities including games, crafts, drama, interactive Bible
    teaching, music and outings.
